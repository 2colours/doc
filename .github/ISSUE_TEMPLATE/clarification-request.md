<!--
  Feel free to delete anything that definitely does not apply to your
  issue, as well as these comments. (Or don’t, it’s up to you.)

  Please paste (a) link(s) from your browser showing the issue (bare
  so it can be seen, not buried in a Markdown link).

  Often a clarification request has as much to do with _where_ in the
  docs something is addressed as _how._ If you think something is
  useful but in the wrong place(s), or needs to be in multiple places
  because of where different readers will look, say so!

  If you're not sure where your request for clarification could be
  best dealt with, either provide the URL where you think it should
  be, provide multiple possible URLs, or delete the line.

  Please don't provide a URL you wish existed that does not -- that
  should be in a "New material" request instead.

<!--
  Also include the commit hash shown at the bottom of your browser
  page, so we know what version you’re looking at. Better yet, include
  the entire “From FILE.pod6 at perl6/doc on GitHub, commit a0b1c2d.”
  line you’ll find as the first line of every doc page’s footer. -->

## The problem

<!--

  Please describe the content you feel needs clarification. A quote,
  cut and pasted, would be much appreciated (use `> ` or a blockquote
  so we can easily see where it begins and ends).

-->

## Suggestions


<!--
  If applicable, tell us in "Suggestions" what could be done to solve
  the problem, such as "Rephrase the description" or "Change the
  example program so it doesn't introduce two unrelated concepts at
  once."

  If you don't know how to fix the issue, please don't worry about
  exact fixes. However, even a vague description of what would help
  will help us help you to help everyone!

  On the other hand, if you feel you know _exactly_ how to fix the
  issue, feel free to submit a pull request if you're comfortable
  doing so--see the CONTRIBUTING.md doc for details. We welcome
  patches! Note that clarification patches (unlike simple fix patches)
  are more likely to require some back-and-forth before being
  merged.

  Thank you for contributing to the Perl 6 community by reporting
  this!

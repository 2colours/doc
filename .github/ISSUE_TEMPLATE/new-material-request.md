<!--
  Feel free to delete anything that definitely does not apply to your
  issue, as well as these comments. (Or don’t, it’s up to you.)

  If your request has to do with an addition to existing material,
  please paste (a) link(s) from your browser showing the issue (bare
  so it can be seen, not buried in a Markdown link).

  Please note this is _not_ the place to request a new feature be
  added to the Perl 6 language--even a small change, like an
  additional multi variant or a tweak to a method parameter. We
  only document the language as it is today.

  If you're not sure where your request could be best dealt with,
  either provide the URL where you think it should be, provide
  multiple possible URLs, or delete the line. If you just have an idea
  of the section ("Language," "Types", etc.) include that in "The
  problem" below.

  Please don't provide a URL you wish existed that does not -- if you
  have an idea for one, please provide it in "Suggestions" below
  instead.

  **Should be in URL:** URL-HERE

## The request

<!--
  Please describe the content you feel needs to be added. As much
  specificity as possible is appreciated. For example, if you thing a
  new code example is what is called for, or new text, or both, or a
  new tutorial, say so.

  Please note we do not have the ability to add diagrams at present
  aside from the type graphs.

  If you don't know how to fix the issue (this _is_ a documentation
  site and we expect it to be used by people who are not expert!),
  please don't worry about exact fixes. However, even a vague
  description of what would help will help us help you to help
  everyone!

  On the other hand, if you feel you know _exactly_ how to fix the
  issue, feel free to submit a pull request if you're comfortable
  doing so--see the CONTRIBUTING.md doc for details. We welcome
  patches! Note that clarification patches (unlike simple fix patches)
  are more likely to require some back-and-forth before being
  merged.

  Thank you for contributing to the Perl 6 community by reporting
  this!

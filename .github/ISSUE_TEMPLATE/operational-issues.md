<!-- This issue type is mostly for contributors and developers. If you are seeing an issue with the website and youâ€™re not involved in this project, you probably want a different issue type.

Also, note that the site is available in at least two places: https://docs.perl6.org/ and https://perl6docs.github.io/ (and the latter will usually be more up to date).

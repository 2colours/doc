<!--
  Feel free to delete anything that definitely does not apply to your
  issue, as well as these comments. (Or don’t, it’s up to you.)

  FIRST!: Check the site at https://perl6docs.github.io/ rather than
  docs.perl.org; you may find the issue already fixed—the
  perl6docs.github.io site is updated more frequently.

  Please paste (a) link(s) from your browser showing the issue (bare
  so it can be seen, not buried in a Markdown link): -->
  **Found in URL:** URL-HERE
<!--
  Also include the commit hash shown at the bottom of your browser
  page, so we know what version you’re looking at. Better yet, include
  the entire “From FILE.pod6 at perl6/doc on GitHub, commit a0b1c2d.”
  line you’ll find as the first line of every doc page’s footer. -->
**Found at commit:** COMMIT-OR-FROM-LINE-HERE
## The problem

<!--
    Please state clearly in "The problem" whether you are reporting a
    problem with the site (something does not show up in the search
    drop-down menu or a page is missing, for instance), documentation
    text or examples that are missing or should be improved or
    something else. Please describe the problem as clearly as possible.

    If it is a formatting issue, we’d appreciate an inline screenshot
    from your browser. (On most operating systems, you can simply drag
    a screenshot image from your file browser into this text box at
    the place you want it to appear.) Annotating and/or cropping the
    image to show the problem in context, but without unnecessary clutter
    like your browser interface, is appreciated though not required.

-->

## Suggestions


<!--
    If applicable, tell us in "Suggestions" what could be done to
    solve the problem, such as "Rephrase the description" or "Use an
    example program that actually runs".

    If you don't know how to fix the issue (this _is_ a documentation
    site and we expect it to be used by people who are not expert!)
    please don't worry about exact fixes. However, if you can't even
    think of what you'd like to see instead (e.g., "working code", "a
    correct return type"), you may be using the wrong issue type and
    should consider a different one.

    On the other hand, if you know _exactly_ how to fix the issue
    (such as fixing a routine signature), feel free to submit a pull
    request if you're comfortable doing so--see the CONTRIBUTING.md
    doc for details. We welcome patches!

    Thank you for contributing to the Perl 6 community by reporting this!
